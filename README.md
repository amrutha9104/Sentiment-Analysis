# Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes – A Case Study

This repository presents a brief case study on building a sentiment analysis model using the Naive Bayes Classifier. The objective is to classify text (e.g., product reviews, tweets) into positive or negative sentiments.

## 📌 Overview
Sentiment analysis is a key application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the goal is to identify the emotional tone behind a body of text. In this case study, we:

Collected and preprocessed textual data

Transformed text into numerical features using techniques like Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF

Built and evaluated a Naive Bayes model for binary sentiment classification

## 🔧 Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development and visualization)

## 🚀 How to Run
### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-naive-bayes.git
cd sentiment-analysis-naive-bayes

### Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the Jupyter notebook or execute the script to train the model:
jupyter notebook notebooks/sentiment_analysis_naive_bayes.ipynb

## ✅ Results
The Naive Bayes classifier was able to achieve solid baseline performance on the sentiment classification task, demonstrating its simplicity and effectiveness for text-based problems.

## 📚 Learnings
Text preprocessing and feature extraction are crucial steps for NLP tasks.

Naive Bayes performs surprisingly well on small to medium-sized text classification problems.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps to uncover patterns and improve feature engineering.

## 📌 Future Improvements
Experiment with other models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or deep learning-based methods

Use more advanced feature representations like word embeddings

Expand dataset and evaluate on real-world data
